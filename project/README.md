Blinky Buzzy Toy:

For my toy, only the buzzer and the blink will play, but due to two errors,
"Fatal Error: File "timer.h" does not exist", and my attempts to fix this, my
code doesn't compile into the module.

Only MakeFiles in my project and Timer directory compile completely. My toy
Makefile doesn't run because of the errors I mentioned beforehand.
