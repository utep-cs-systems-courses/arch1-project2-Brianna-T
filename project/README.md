Blinky Buzzy Toy:

#How to Complie/Run

For my toy, you must be in its directory 'project'. Once in, go to directory
'timerLib', and type out the command 'make install'. This will set up the
timer methods inside, and then exit out of that directory. Next, go inside
'Toy' directory, and run command 'make load'.

#Description

My toy will begin with the green LED blinking on and off every second that
passes by. Next, the buzzer will sound, stop, then continue to sound. I have a
method that was supposed to have the buzzer's tone go up, down, then back to
its original tone, but it won't change. It goes through the loop, but keeps
the same tone.

#How to use

There is no button set up to 'use' this toy. Once its plugged in and runs, it's being used.
